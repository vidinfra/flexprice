[Flexprice](https://flexprice.io) is a **developer first** answer to building and launching any pricing model and collecting usage data in real-time.

We have one goal - our friends should never have to write a billing system from scratch again.

## The struggle is real since AI is here

<img src="./assets/struggle.png" alt="Record Replay Testing"/>

In-house Billing Systems are a nightmare for Engineers. With rising use of AI workloads internally and building new AI features, it has become necessary to build metering and billing systems to track usage and costs.

Frequency of changes in pricing models is also increasing. These changes make it hard to manage existing subscriptions and require a lot of manual effort in terms of migrations and testing.


## The Solution: Flexprice

Usage metering, subscription management and infra cost into one stack
