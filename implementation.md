2. Whenever user changes the plan in subscription
    - Archived the old Subscription
    - Calculate the prorated charges
    - Create a new subscription with proration mode active
    - Invoice will be generated 
    - Add the old subscription credit or charges to new subscription invoice

3. DTO:
    - SubscriptionChangeRequest
        - TargetPlanID
        - ProrationMode

     2. Execute Subscription Change
